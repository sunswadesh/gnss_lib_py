Tutorials
=========


The goal of this library is to easily interact with standard GNSS
datasets and file types and run baseline algorithms on measurements
in these datasets/data types.

The :code:`gnss_lib_py` library is divided into submodles, as
described :ref:`here<organization>` and the tutorials are similarly
organized.

These tutorials are in interactive Jupyter notebooks and have been rendered
as part of the documentation.
You can run the code yourself by running the notebooks in the 'tutorials'
directory `here <https://github.com/Stanford-NavLab/gnss_lib_py/tree/main/notebooks/tutorials>`__.
The notebooks can also be run in Google Colab without downloading the
repository by selecting the 'Open in Colab' option at the top of each
notebook.

The tutorials below show you how to load datasets, interact with our
standard :Code:`NavData` class, run baseline algorithms, generate metrics
for the resultant estimates, and visualize results and data.

All of this can be accomplished with a few lines of code and modularly.


NavData Tutorials

Parser Tutorials
----------------

These tutorials explain existing parsers and how to create a new
parser that inherits from :code:`NavData` to handle new measurement types
and/or files.
