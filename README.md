gnss_lib_py
===========

`gnss_lib_py` is a modular Python tool for parsing, analyzing, and
visualizing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data and state
estimates.
It also provides an intuitive and modular framework which allows users to
quickly prototype, implement, and visualize GNSS algorithms.
`gnss_lib_py` is modular in the sense that multiple types of
algorithms or datasets can be easily exchanged for each other.
It is extendable in facilitating user-specific extensions of existing
implementations.

`gnss_lib_py` contains parsers for common file types used for
storing GNSS measurements, benchmark algorithms for processing
measurements into state estimates and visualization tools for measurements
and state estimates.
The modularity of `gnss_lib_py` is made possibly by the unifying
`NavData` class, with accompanying standard nomenclature, which can be
found in the
[reference page](https://gnss-lib-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/reference.html).
The standard nomenclature ensures cross compatibility between different
datasets and algorithms.

`NavData` combines the readability of `pandas.DataFrame` with `numpy.ndarray`
allowing for easy and fast access of numbers or strings.
We also provide functionality to add, remove and modify numeric and
string data consistently along with commonly needed supporting
functionality.

```
In the directory organization above:

  * The `algorithms` directory contains algorithms that
    work by passing in a `NavData` class. Currently, the following
    algorithms are implemented in the `algorithms`:

      * Weighted Least Squares
      * Extended Kalman Filter
      * Calculating pseudorange residuals
      * Fault detection and exclusion

  * The `navdata` directory defines the `NavData` class, its methods, and
    functions that operate on `NavData` instances, like `sort`, `concat`,
    and others.

  * The data parsers in the `parsers` directory allow for either loading
    GNSS data into `gnss_lib_py`'s unifying `NavData` class or parsing
    precise ephemerides data.
    Currently, the following datasets and types are supported:

      * [2021 Google Android Derived Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-smartphone-decimeter-challenge)
      * [2022 Google Android Derived Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/smartphone-decimeter-2022)
      * [TU Chemnitz smartLoc Dataset](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/projekt/smartLoc/gnss_dataset.html.en#Datasets)
      * [NMEA](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/GPS/NMEA%20Reference%20Manual-Rev2.1-Dec07.pdf)
      * [RINEX .o and .n](https://files.igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex305.pdf)
      * [SP3 precise orbits](https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/GNSS/orbit_products.html)
      * [CLK clock products](https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/GNSS/clock_products.html)

  * The `utils` directory contains utilities used to handle
    GNSS measurements, time conversions, coordinate transformations,
    visualizations, calculating multi-GNSS satellite PVT information,
    satellite simulation, file operations, etc.

  * The `visualizations` directory contains methods for plotting quantities
    in `NavData`. It includes methods to plot metrics, positions on maps,
    and skyplots of satellites visible from the receiver position.
